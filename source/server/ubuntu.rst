Ubuntu Linux Server
===================

We typically recommend newcomers to oTree to deploy to Heroku
(see instructions :ref:`here <heroku>`).

However, you may prefer to run oTree on a proper Linux server. Reasons may include:

-   Your lab doesn't have internet
-   You want full control over server configuration
-   You want better performance (local servers have less latency)

Install apt-get packages
------------------------

Run::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip git

Create a virtualenv
-------------------

It's a best practice to use a virtualenv::

    python3 -m venv venv_otree

To activate this venv every time you start your shell, put this in your ``.bashrc`` or ``.profile``::

    source ~/venv_otree/bin/activate

Once your virtualenv is active, you will see ``(venv_otree)`` at the beginning
of your prompt.

.. _postgres-linux:

Database (Postgres)
-------------------

Install Postgres and psycopg2, create a new database and set the ``DATABASE_URL`` env var, for example:
to ``postgres://postgres@localhost/django_db``

Reset the database on the server
--------------------------------

``cd`` to the folder containing your oTree project.
Install the requirements and reset the database::

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    otree resetdb


.. _prodserver:

Running the server
------------------

Testing the production server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From your project folder, run::

    otree prodserver 8000

Then navigate in your browser to your server's
IP/hostname followed by ``:8000``.

If you're not using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache,
you probably want to run oTree directly on port 80.
This requires superuser permission, so let's use sudo,
but add some extra args to preserve environment variables like ``PATH``,
``DATABASE_URL``, etc::

    sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" otree prodserver 80

Try again to open your browser;
this time, you don't need to append :80 to the URL, because that is the default HTTP port.

Unlike ``devserver``, ``prodserver`` does not restart automatically
when your files are changed.

Set remaining environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add these in the same place where you set ``DATABASE_URL``::

    export OTREE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=my_password
    #export OTREE_PRODUCTION=1 # uncomment this line to enable production mode
    export OTREE_AUTH_LEVEL=DEMO

(Optional) Process control system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the server is working as described above,
it's a good practice to use
a process control system like Supervisord or Circus.
This will restart your processes in case they crash,
keep it running if you log out, etc.

Circus
``````

Install Circus, then create a ``circus.ini`` in your project folder,
with the following content::

    [watcher:webapp]
    cmd = otree
    args = prodserver 80
    use_sockets = True
    copy_env = True

Then run::

    sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" circusd circus.ini

If this is working properly, you can start it as a daemon::

    sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" circusd --daemon circus.ini --log-output=circus-logs.txt


To stop circus, run::

    circusctl stop

(Optional) Apache, Nginx, etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use Apache or Nginx as your primary web server,
because oTree must be run with an ASGI server.
However, you still might want to use Apache/Nginx as a reverse proxy, for the following reasons:

-   You are trying to optimize serving of static files
    (though oTree uses Whitenoise, which is already fairly efficient)
-   You need to host other websites on the same server
-   You need features like SSL or proxy buffering

If you set up a reverse proxy, make sure to enable not only HTTP traffic
but also websockets.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you get strange behavior,
such as random changes each time the page reloads,
it might be caused by another oTree instance that didn't shut down.
Try stopping oTree and reload again.

Sharing a server with other oTree users
---------------------------------------

You can share a server with other oTree users;
you just have to make sure that the code and databases are kept separate,
so they don't conflict with each other.

On the server you should create a different Unix user for each person
using oTree. Then each person should follow the same steps described above,
but in some cases name things differently to avoid clashes:

-   Create a virtualenv in their home directory
-   Create a different Postgres database, as described earlier,
    and set this in the DATABASE_URL env var.

Once these steps are done, the second user can push code to the server,
then run ``otree resetdb``.

If you don't need multiple people to run experiments simultaneously,
then each user can take turns running the server on port 80 with ``otree prodserver 80``.
However, if multiple people need to run experiments at the same time,
then you would need to run the server on multiple ports, e.g. ``8000``,
``8001``, etc.
