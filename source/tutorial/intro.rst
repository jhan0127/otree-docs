This tutorial will cover the creation of several apps.

First, you should be familiar with Python; we have a simple tutorial here: :ref:`python_tutorial`.

.. note::

    In addition to this tutorial, you should check out
    oTree Hub's
    `featured apps <https://www.otreehub.com/projects/?featured=1>`__
    section.
    Find an app that is similar to what you want to build,
    and learn by example.
