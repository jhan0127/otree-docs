.. _bots:

Bots
====

Bots simulate participants playing your app.
They click through each page, fill out forms, and make sure that everything works properly.

This feature is designed for lazy people who would prefer
for oTree to automatically test their apps for them.
And oTree Studio can even design your bot code for you,
so the whole process (writing and running bots) involves barely any effort.

.. _browser-bots:

Running bots
------------

-   Add bots to your app (see instructions below)
-   In your session config, set ``use_browser_bots=True``.
-   Run your server and create a session. The pages will auto-play
    with browser bots, once the start links are opened.

Writing tests
-------------

In oTree Studio, go to the "Tests" section of your app.
Click the button to auto-write bots code.
If you want to refine the code that was generated
(such as adding ``expect()`` statements),
read the below sections.

If you are using a text editor, go to ``tests.py``.
See examples of how to define ``tests.py`` `here <https://github.com/oTree-org/otree>`__.

Submitting pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should make one ``yield`` per page submission. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    yield pages.Start
    yield pages.Survey, dict(name="Bob", age=20)

Here, we first submit the ``Start`` page, which does not contain a form.
The following page has 2 form fields, so we submit a dict.

The test system will raise an error if the bot submits invalid input for a page,
or if it submits pages in the wrong order.

You use ``if`` statements to play any player or round number. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    if self.round_number == 1:
        yield pages.Introduction
    if self.player.id_in_group == 1:
        yield pages.Offer, dict(offer=30)
    else:
        yield pages.Accept, dict(offer_accepted=True)


Your ``if`` statements can depend on ``self.player``, ``self.group``,
``self.round_number``, etc.

Ignore wait pages when writing bots.

Rounds
~~~~~~

Your bot code should just play 1 round at a time.
oTree will automatically execute it ``NUM_ROUNDS`` times.

.. _expect:

expect()
~~~~~~~~

You can use ``expect`` statements to ensure that your code is working as you expect.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    expect(self.player.num_apples, 100)
    yield pages.Eat, dict(apples_eaten=1)
    expect(self.player.num_apples, 99)
    yield pages.SomeOtherPage

If ``self.player.num_apples`` is not 99, then you will be alerted with an error.

You can also use expect with 3 arguments, like ``expect(self.player.budget, '<', 100)``.
This will verify that ``self.player.budget`` is less than 100.
You can use the following operators:
``'<'``,
``'<='``,
``'=='``,
``'>='``,
``'>'``,
``'!='``,
``'in'``,
``'not in'``.

Testing form validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use :ref:`form validation <form-validation>`,
you should test that your app is correctly rejecting invalid input from the user,
by using ``SubmissionMustFail()``.

For example, let's say you have this page:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyPage(Page):

        form_model = 'player'
        form_fields = ['int1', 'int2']

        @staticmethod
        def error_message(player, values):
            if values["int1"] + values["int2"] != 100:
                return 'The numbers must add up to 100'

Here is how to test that it is working properly:

.. code-block:: python

    yield SubmissionMustFail(pages.MyPage, dict(int1=99, int2=0))
    yield pages.MyPage, dict(int1=99, int2=1)

The bot will submit ``MyPage`` twice. If the first submission **succeeds**,
an error will be raised, because it is not supposed to succeed.


Checking the HTML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``self.html`` contains the HTML of the page you are about to submit.
You can use this together with ``expect()``:

.. code-block:: python

    if self.player.id_in_group == 1:
        expect(self.player.is_winner, True)
        print(self.html)
        expect('you won the game', 'in', self.html)
    else:
        expect(self.player.is_winner, False)
        expect('you did not win', 'in', self.html)
    yield pages.Results
    # etc...

``self.html`` is updated with the next page's HTML, after every ``yield`` statement.
Linebreaks and extra spaces are ignored.

Automatic HTML checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An error will be raised if the bot is trying to submit form fields that are not actually found
in the page's HTML, or if the page's HTML is missing a submit button.

However, the bot system is not able to see fields and buttons that are added dynamically with JavaScript.
In these cases, you should disable the HTML check by using ``Submission``
with ``check_html=False``. For example, change this:

.. code-block:: python

    yield pages.MyPage, dict(foo=99)

to this:

.. code-block:: python

    yield Submission(pages.MyPage, dict(foo=99), check_html=False)

(If you used ``Submission`` without ``check_html=False``,
the two code samples would be equivalent.)

.. _bot_timeout:

Simulate a page timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use ``Submission`` with ``timeout_happened=True``:

.. code-block:: python

    yield Submission(pages.MyPage, dict(foo=99), timeout_happened=True)
