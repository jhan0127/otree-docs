oTree Studio
============

`oTree Studio <https://www.otreehub.com/studio>`__
is a point-and-click interface for building oTree apps.
It is free to use for small/medium sized projects.

We recommend using oTree Studio instead of a text editor,
because it makes learning oTree easier and
prevents common mistakes.

Even if you are able to follow a tutorial using a text editor,
be aware that things get more challenging when you try to implement something on your own,
and that is when oTree Studio helps by keeping you on the right path.

Here are some `YouTube videos <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9BIa4PqQJt1bjXoe7ffPg/videos>`__ about oTree Studio.
